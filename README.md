# Telemetry Dashboard for Qlik Sense
#### Download Latest [Here](https://github.com/eapowertools/qs-telemetry-dashboard/releases/latest)
With the February 2018 of Qlik Sense, it is possible to capture granular usage metrics from the QIX in-memory engine based on configurable thresholds.  This provides the ability to capture CPU and RAM utilization of individual chart objects, CPU and RAM utilization of reload tasks, and more.

This tool is a continuation from the 'old' Telemetry Dashboard. It has been re-written with a new 'install' process to bring incremental load and solve for a variety of different installer issues.

### Requirements
 - Qlik Sense Enterprise February 2018 or later
